KeepItUp
========

A Python tool to prevent hard disks from going to sleep.

Many external HDD enclosures come with the dreaded "power-saving" feature - making them turn off after a few minutes when they haven't been used.
What this tool does is to simply make all your fixed drives "busy" every few minutes - by writing a small file - this prevents them from going to sleep.

Rest assured that this will not hog any resources.
