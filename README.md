KeepItUp
========

A Python tool to prevent hard disks from going to sleep.

Many external HDD enclosures come with the dreaded "power-saving" feature - making them turn off after a few minutes when they haven't been used, and be less responsive when you access them later and have to hear that "spinning-up" noise until they become accesible.
What this tool does is to simply make all your fixed drives "busy" every few minutes - by writing a small (5KB) file - thus preventing them from going to sleep.

Rest assured that this will not hog any resources.

As for some credits - this was aspired by [HDDCoffee](http://psichron.za.net/wordpress/2009-11-29/hddcoffee/).
